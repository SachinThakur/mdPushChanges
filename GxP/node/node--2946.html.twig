/**
* @file
* Theme override to display a node.
*
* Available variables:
* - node: The node entity with limited access to object properties and methods.
Only "getter" methods (method names starting with "get", "has", or "is")
and a few common methods such as "id" and "label" are available. Calling
other methods (such as node.delete) will result in an exception.
* - label: The title of the node.
* - content: All node items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
*   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
*   {{ content|without('field_example') }} to temporarily suppress the printing
*   of a given child element.
* - author_picture: The node author user entity, rendered using the "compact"
*   view mode.
* - metadata: Metadata for this node.
* - date: Themed creation date field.
* - author_name: Themed author name field.
* - url: Direct URL of the current node.
* - display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
* - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
*   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
*   classes:
*   - node: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
*   - node--type-[type]: The current node type. For example, if the node is an
*     "Article" it would result in "node--type-article". Note that the machine
*     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
*   - node--view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the node; for example, a
*     teaser would result in: "node--view-mode-teaser", and
*     full: "node--view-mode-full".
*   The following are controlled through the node publishing options.
*   - node--promoted: Appears on nodes promoted to the front page.
*   - node--sticky: Appears on nodes ordered above other non-sticky nodes in
*     teaser listings.
*   - node--unpublished: Appears on unpublished nodes visible only to site
*     admins.
* - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
*   tag that appears in the template.
* - content_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main
*   content tag that appears in the template.
* - author_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the author of
*   the node tag that appears in the template.
* - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
*   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
* - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
*   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
* - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
* - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
* - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
* - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
*   node cannot hold the main body content.
* - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
*   current user is a logged-in member.
* - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
*   is an administrator.
*
* @ingroup templates
*
* @see template_preprocess_node()
*
* @todo Remove the id attribute (or make it a class), because if that gets
*   rendered twice on a page this is invalid CSS for example: two lists
*   in different view modes.
